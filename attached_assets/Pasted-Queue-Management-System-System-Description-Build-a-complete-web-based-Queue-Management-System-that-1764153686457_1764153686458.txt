Queue Management System

System Description

Build a complete web-based Queue Management System that allows customers to join a virtual queue using only their smartphone—no physical ticket printers or hardware devices are required. Businesses manage the queue from a simple dashboard while customers track their waiting time remotely through a responsive web application.

The system should work smoothly for administrations, clinics, restaurants, garages, and any business where clients must wait for service.

Core Objectives

Replace physical waiting lines with virtual queue tickets.

Allow customers to join the queue via QR code or short link.

Show customers real-time queue status, updated instantly.

Notify customers when their turn is near.

Provide businesses with a dashboard to control the queue.

Require no additional hardware—works with any smartphone or browser.

Be light, fast, scalable, and intuitive for non-tech users.
